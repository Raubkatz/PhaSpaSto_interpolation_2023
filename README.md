# PhaSpaSto_interpolation_2023
This is an implementation of the interpolation method from https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/5/718
If your find any errors or issues, text me on researchgate https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian-Raubitzek-2


First, run generate population_2023.py

Second, run genetic_algorithm_2023.py


The parameters etc. are explained in the programs, if you still got problems text me on researchgate.

If you use this interpolation or parts from it in a publication, then I'd be happy to be cited :)
